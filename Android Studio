What does Arctic Fox mean? 
- Android Studio recently migrated to a year-based versioning, inline with the IntelliJ version system. 
- So when we say Android Studio 2020.3.1 the middle digit ".3" is the Intellij major version and the last digit ".1" is the studio major version.
- Each release also has its own code name that alphabetically represents the studio major version. So for ".1" the letter would be "A." 
- And there we have it! 
- #Android Studio Arctic Fox!
